Dan's Reverse Polish Language

Aims to have as few commands as possible with macros to extend.
Stack based.

Considerations: A read only stack or a preinitialised stack. Maybe needs return codes.

Commands
w write: Pops fd, string. Pushes nothing.
r read: Pops fd, string. Pushes nothing.
b blocking-read: Pops fd, string. Pushes nothing.
c copy: Pops any, Pushes two any.
+ add: Pops two numbers, pushes one.
- sub: Pops two numbers, pushes one.
* mul: Pops two numbers, pushes one.
/ div: Pops two numbers, pushes one (dies horribly if #2 is 0).
f func: May define a function or macro somehow later.
s swap: Pops two any, pushes in reverse order.
j jump: may not be needed since we want it more functional
l loop: may or may not be a macro depending on 

Macros

p print: 1 w
i input: 0 b
l loop: something like je e 0 - e; which would require asm's je
but we might not do jumping hmm...
